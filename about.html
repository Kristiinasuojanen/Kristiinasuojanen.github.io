                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Porvoo, Finland and moved to Otaniemi, Espoo to study in September 2019. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I am currently a second year sudent in the field of information networks. You can read more about my studies below.
                    <br> <br>
                    I've always had many hobbies, and currently I'm also doing some volunteer work in the Aalto community, read more below.
                    <br> <br>
                    As a person I'm innovative, and enjoy working on diffrent projects were I can implement my skills and creativity. 
                    <br>
                    I dream about becoming an entrepreneur, and starting my own company one day.

                <h2>Studying Information networks</h2>
                <p>
                    Information networks is a major at the school of science in Aalto University. I started my studies in 2019, and plan on graduating (diplomi-insinööri) in 2024.
                    <br> <br>
                    My studies consist of programming, IEM (industrial engineering and management), maths and more human and user based courses. I'm able to understand and communicate with different stakeholders, as I know about technology and managemet as well as the customers and employees. 
                    <br> <br>
                    As my minor I've chosen physics. I enjoy the courses very much since I like problem solving, and in my opinion the tasks and calculations really challenge me.

                <h2>Hobbies and volunteer work</h2>
                <p>
                    My main hobby is tennis, I've played (and coached) for many years now. In 2021 I'm the chair of the board at Aalto Tennis. Aalto Tennis is a official tennisclub that concentrates on students.
                    <br> <br>
                    I've also been sailing my entire life, and enjoy getting out on the waters every summer. I've sailed both dinghys and keelboats. And in winter I love to go skiing.
                    <br>
                    Currently I'm training for my first marathon, wich I plan to run in 2021. 
                    <br>
                    Lately me and my friends have started playing padel every week. I enjoy the game, since it's fun and easy to play.
                    <br>
                    I would also call cooking a hobby of mine, I'm always looking for new and callenging recipies to try out. I try to stay on top of food trends, but enjoy making the classic dishes aswell.
                    <br><br>
                    As voluntary work for my guild Athene at Aalto, I will be responsible for the sportsclub Ethana together with my friend. We plan on organizing sporting events and competitions for fellow students.
